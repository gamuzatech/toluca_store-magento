## Requirements

- PHP 7.3+ (PHP 8.0 is supported, PHP 8.1 is work in progress)
- MySQL 5.6+ (8.0+ recommended) or MariaDB


- PHP extension `intl` <small>since 1.9.4.19 & 20.0.17</small>
- Command `patch` 2.7+ (or `gpatch` on MacOS/HomeBrew) <small>since 1.9.5.0 & 20.1.0</small>

__Please be aware that although OpenMage is compatible that one or more extensions may not be.__

### Optional

- Redis 5+ (6.x recommended, latest verified compatible 6.0.7 with 20.x)

## Installation

### Composer

Download the latest archive and extract it, clone the repo, or add a composer dependency to your existing project like so:

```bash
composer require "openmage/magento-lts":"^19.5.0"
```

To get the latest changes use:

```bash
composer require "openmage/magento-lts":"dev-main"
```

<small>Note: `dev-main` is just an alias for current `1.9.4.x` branch and may change</small>

### Git

If you want to contribute to the project:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR GIT USERNAME>/magento-lts
git pull origin main
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts
git pull upstream 1.9.4.x
git add -A && git commit
```

[More Information](http://openmage.github.io/magento-lts/install.html)

## Secure your installation

Don't use common paths like /admin for OpenMage Backend URL. Don't use the path in _robots.txt_ and keep it secret. You can change it from Backend (System / Configuration / Admin / Admin Base Url) or by editing _app/etc/local.xml_:

```xml
<config>
    <admin>
        <routers>
            <adminhtml>
                <args>
                    <frontName><![CDATA[admin]]></frontName>
                </args>
            </adminhtml>
        </routers>
    </admin>
</config>
```

Don't use common file names like api.php for OpenMage API URLs to prevent attacks. Don't use the new file name in _robots.txt_ and keep it secret with your partners. After renaming the file you must update the webserver configuration as follows:

### Apache .htaccess
```
RewriteRule ^api/rest api.php?type=rest [QSA,L]
```

### Nginx
```
rewrite ^/api/(\w+).*$ /api.php?type=$1 last;`
```

## Changes

Most important changes will be listed here, all other changes since `19.4.0` can be found in
[release](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases) notes.

### Between Magento 1.9.4.5 and OpenMage 19.x

### Since OpenMage 19.5.0 / 20.1.0

Most of the 3rd party libraries/modules that were bundled in our repository were removed and migrated to composer dependencies.
This allows for better maintenance and upgradability.

Specifically:
- `phpseclib`, `mcrypt_compat`, `Cm_RedisSession`, `Cm_Cache_Backend_Redis`, `Pelago_Emogrifier` ([#2411](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/2411))
- Zend Framework 1 ([#2827](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/pull/2827))

If your project uses OpenMage through composer then all dependencies will be managed automatically.  
If you just extracted the release zip/tarball in your project's main folder then be sure to:
- remove the old copy of aforementioned libraries from your project, you can do that with this command:
  ```bash
  rm -rf app/code/core/Zend lib/Cm lib/Credis lib/mcryptcompat lib/Pelago lib/phpseclib lib/Zend
  ```

- download the new release zip file that is named `openmage-VERSIONNUMBER.zip`, this one is built to contain the `vendor`
  folder generated by composer, with all the dependencies in it
- extract the zip file in your project's repository as you always did

We also decided to remove our Zend_DB patches (that were stored in `app/code/core/Zend`) because they were very old and
not compatible with the new implementations made by ZF1-Future, which is much more advanced and feature rich.
This may generate a problem with `Zend_Db_Select' statements that do not use 'Zend_Db_Expr' to quote expressions.
If you see SQL errors after upgrading please remember to check for this specific issue in your code.

### New Config Options

- `admin/design/use_legacy_theme`
- `admin/global_search/enable`
- `admin/emails/admin_notification_email_template`
- `catalog/product_image/progressive_threshold`
- `catalog/search/search_separator`
- `dev/log/max_level`
- `newsletter/security/enable_form_key`
- `sitemap/category/lastmod`
- `sitemap/page/lastmod`
- `sitemap/product/lastmod`

### New Events

- `adminhtml_block_widget_form_init_form_values_after`
- `adminhtml_block_widget_tabs_html_before`
- `adminhtml_sales_order_create_save_before`
- `checkout_cart_product_add_before`
- `sitemap_cms_pages_generating_before`
- `sitemap_urlset_generating_before`

[Full list of events](docs/EVENTS.md)

### Changes to SOAP/WSDL

Since `19.4.17`/`20.0.15` we changed the `targetNamespace` of all the WSDL files (used in the API modules), from `Magento` to `OpenMage`.
If your custom modules extends OpenMage's APIs with a custom WSDL file and there are some hardcoded `targetNamespace="urn:Magento"` strings, your APIs may stop working.

Please replace all occurrences of 

```
targetNamespace="urn:Magento"
```
with
```
targetNamespace="urn:OpenMage"
```
or alternatively 
```
targetNamespace="urn:{{var wsdl.name}}"
```
 to avoid any problem.

To find which files need the modification you can run this command from the root directory of your project.
```bash
grep -rn 'urn:Magento' --include \*.xml
```

## Development Environment with DDEV

- Install [ddev](https://ddev.com/get-started/)
- Clone the repository as described in installation ([Git](#git))
- Create a ddev config, defaults should be good for you
  ```bash
  ddev config
  ```
- Open `.ddev/config.yaml` and change the php version to your needs
- Download and start the containers
  ```bash
  ddev start
  ```
- Open your site in browser
  ```bash
  ddev launch
  ```

## Development with PHP 8.1

Deprecation errors are supressed by default.

If you want to work on PHP 8.1 support, set environment variable `DEV_PHP_STRICT` to `1`, to show all errors.  

## PhpStorm Factory Helper

This repo includes class maps for the core Magento files in `.phpstorm.meta.php`.
To add class maps for installed extensions, you have to install [N98-magerun](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun)
and run command:

```bash
n98-magerun.phar dev:ide:phpstorm:meta
```

You can add additional meta files in this directory to cover your own project files. See
[PhpStorm advanced metadata](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/ide-advanced-metadata.html)
for more information.

## Versioning

Though Magento does __not__ follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) we aim to provide a workable system for
dependency definition.
